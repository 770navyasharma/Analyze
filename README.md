# Automated Data Processing and Publishing

## Summary

This project demonstrates an automated workflow for processing data using Python and Pandas, generating a JSON output, and publishing it as a static asset via GitHub Pages. The workflow is orchestrated through GitHub Actions, ensuring the `result.json` is always up-to-date and accessible following every push to the repository.

## Setup

This project generates and publishes a static JSON file via GitHub Pages. Therefore, no local setup is explicitly required to run or view the project's primary output. The Python script and data processing occur entirely within the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

## Usage

The primary output of this project is a `result.json` file generated and published through GitHub Pages. To view the live, deployed output:

1.  Navigate to the GitHub Pages URL associated with this repository.
2.  Append `/result.json` to the base URL (e.g., `https://<YOUR_USERNAME>.github.io/<YOUR_REPOSITORY>/result.json`).
3.  Your browser will display the raw JSON data, which can be viewed directly or further processed by other applications.

## Code Explanation

This project's core logic resides in `execute.py`, a Python script that leverages the Pandas library to process `data.csv`. The script's primary function is to transform this data and output the processed results into a `result.json` file.

The project relies heavily on GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to:
*   Ensure code quality using `ruff` for linting.
*   Execute `execute.py` to generate `result.json`.
*   Publish the generated `result.json` artifact to GitHub Pages.

It's important to note that **this repository does not contain any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files** for client-side rendering. The 'static site' aspect refers to GitHub Pages serving the raw `result.json` file directly. While a separate frontend application could be developed to consume and visualize this JSON data, such client-side components are outside the scope of this specific project.
